# Random Password Generator

## Description

This website's primary fuction is to use Javascript to generate a random password based on user inputs. These passwords are random and can be up to 128 characters long, making the password as secure as is needed. Whilst building the program, I learned plenty about Javascript, including but not limited to functions, variables, if statements, for loops, window prompts, and more. I also was able to use the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) to reeuce the code's length significantly.


## Usage

I have attached a screenshot of the website, as well as the website's URL

## Credits

Credit is due to Leif Hetland, my instructor for my SMU Bootcamp course. His help made the random password generation include all the variables input by the user be properly implimented, and also made the coding follow the DRY principle to the best of our abilities.
